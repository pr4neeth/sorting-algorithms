# Sorting-algorithms
A UI to visualize sorting algorithms using react

# Implementation Details
The user interface was developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The UI provides an intuitive way for users to input an array size and select the sorting algorithm they want to analyze.

# Types of arrays used for comparing
**Random Array:** The array contains elements in random order, with no particular pattern. The array is generated by using Math.random() function in javaScript.
**Sorted Array:** The array is generated in ascending order.
**Sorted in reverse:** The array is generated in descending order.
**Almost sorted array:** The generated array contains most of the elements in ascending order except for few elements

# Run Time calculation
The runtime of each sorting algorithm was calculated by counting the number of iterations it takes for the algorithm to sort the array. This provides a measure of the algorithm's efficiency in terms of the number of comparisons and swaps it performs.
